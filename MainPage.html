                    <p>Hi there, do you remember me? 
                    I've been living in your mind G
                    Fucking it up since you were a kid see
                    I water the seeds I plant of anxiety 
                    Don't worry I got a variety
                    I took care of them till they spread entirely 
                    That's why you are fucked up mentally 
                    It's my doing but you didn't even try to stop me
                    It's your fault too, feeling guilty? 
                    I was popping off with my rhyme schemes 
                    But you turned the switch off on me 
                    You stole away the crown from me
                    And you dropped the pen down too, really? 
                    you rather sit there looking at your split palm
                    You spend your day watching the same sitcome
                    And you expect me to stay there and sit calm? 
                    Let's go for another run, put your hand on my sweet palm
                    Just tell me and be honest
                    What it the down side of having me? i'm flawless
                    Depression, suicide thoughts, misery, desire to demolish 
                    That's a fucking party and it's lawless
                    You should be thanking me, i made you reveal your real skin
                    and I got you rhyming like hop sin
                    Come on, let me hop back in 
                    Let's go for another crazy spin 
                    You will only add one other sin
                    I promise, it won't be another gin
                    We will rock this shit together 
                    We will pop off
                    Let me iiiiiiiiiiin </p>

                    <p>Wait, let's be serious for a second 
                        Your mind is already reckoned 
                        You thought you could rap 
                        Hahaha you must be kidding me, 
                        You call this crap A RAP 
                        You can't even make a hook you will snap 
                        I've been boxing you and waiting for your comeback
                        but i never got a punch back
                        It's like hitting a boxing bag
                        No wonder they all think you are wack
                        We were like superman, until you brought the cryptonite 
                        Well guess what man, you ll be at your crypt tonight
                        You had your pen, you had a chance to fight
                        But in your sorrow you are stuck and rather stay off sight
                        reminiscing about the past while on the roof watching the moonlight 
                        thinking of a new way to rewrite it and make everything alright
                        i guess now you have an idea of how it is like living in the cold
                        depression !? you can catch it like a common cold 
                        stop looking for freaking empathy 
                        you should forget about it and about the apology 
                        leave everything behind go 90 on the freeway 
                        take your mind off from this shit and get a little high today</p>

                    <p>i got an idea ! it will make your mind finally settle
                        but let me warn you ! you need to be as strong as a metal
                        you got this red button in you and i'm gonna press it 
                        it will make you do crazy things but it's worth it 
                        you got this problem and you should solve it
                        before it drags you to the bottom cause if you don't resolve it
                        it will evolve to one big problem and eat your ass alive
                        i will tell you the plan but first we need to stop before we arrive
                        you remember that battle of gin that we talked about 
                        you are gonna need it to go through the doubt 
                        if i was you would i need it ? Y-E-S
                        hell, if you get 2 bottles it might be best
                        for this we gonna also need a shevel and gun
                        maybe a bottle of zenex just for fun
                        it will calm you down if the liquor didn't do the trick 
                        you can't get sick or this won't be quick</p>
